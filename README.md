# NOAA Ocean Land Grid Sketch
`noaa-oceanland-gridsketch` provides a set of code that creates generative art that represent ocean, land, or ocean and land global surface temperature anomalies in a gradient colored grid given the anomaly values. The python code provides some rudamentary parsing of `...csv` montly files from NOAA website to create a `.json` file for use. Using a JavaScript suite of tools, `canvas-sketch`, the `.json` file is read to display rows for each year, column for months, and each cell appropriately colored given the color scale and anomaly value.
